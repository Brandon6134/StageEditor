# Stage-Editor
 A stage editor that provides a clean and interactive interface for creating, editing, saving, and loading levels for a game.
 
To use the stage editor, clone this repository then run the stage_editor.py file. Use your left click to place the desired tiles/blocks/items/enemies on the map, and use the right click to erase them. You can hold down the mouse buttons and drag to edit mulitple tiles at once. To change which tile is being placed, click the image of what sprite you want to place. You can scroll right and left throughout the level by pressing the left and right arrow keys, and hold the left shift key down to increase the scroll speed.

To save a level to the current level number, press the save button. To load an existing level number's data, press the load button. To navigate to different levels, press the up and down arrow keys. An additional confirmation window will pop up when trying to overwrite pre-existing sava data for a level or if you are trying to clear a level of it's tiles. If you try to load a level that doesn't have any pre-existing data, the stage editor will load a new empty level except for ground at the bottom row and display a message saying this.
